The reconciliation of AcousticBrainz is not specific. In the genre properties, for the literal objects, the property description in AcousticBrainz is used. For the wikidata link objects, the wikidata property for "genre" (P136) is used because the AcousticBrainz genre is specified in much more details. This causes some loss of meaning in the detail of the genres. The same applies to moods.
