    ns6:description """<p>This reconstructed parchment leaf contains four fragments that are part of a series of musical binding materials ("The Ridgefield Project"). The parchment was used to bind volumes of the "Histoire Ecclesiastique pour servir de continuation à celle de Monsieur l'Abbé Fleury" (Paris, Pierre-Jean Mariette, 1720-1730). (See https://cantusdatabase.org/source/714555.)</p>

<p>The parchment pieces found in the Ridgefield Project appear to be from a thirteenth-century antiphoner and gradual, both from an (as yet unidentified) Cistercian monastery, possibly in France or Belgium.  This half folio, composed of four binding pieces ("Group B") from Volumes 14 and 22 of the Histoire, is from the antiphoner, and contains chants for Matins on the feast of Agatha.</p>

This manuscript contains the first part of the Temporale, from the first Sunday of Advent to the second Sunday after Epiphany. The manuscripts are not numbered in liturgical order, as their connection was not recognized at the time of cataloguing.

Although now held at a Dominican monastery (in the library of the monastery of Friars Minor in Dubrovnik, Croatia), the manuscripts are of Franciscan origin, as described by Ana Čizmić, despite not including material for the feasts of St. Francis, St. Anthony of Padua, and St. Clare. A fourteenth-century antiphoner from a nearby Franciscan monastery in Ston also does not include the feasts for these saints, suggesting that this antiphoner is in concordance with the regional rite of Bosnian Franciscan Friars. An inscription in Codex C confirms that the manuscripts were used by the Franciscan friars in Dubrovnik: “TABULA OFFICIORUM HUIUS ANTIPHONARII SPECTANS AD CHORUM SANCTI FRANCISCI RAGUSII [Dubrovnik].”

A psalter, now also held in the Franjevački Samostan in Dubrovnik (Codex B Nr. 1), was written in a similar hand and bears the colophon: “Explicit psalterium secundum ritum romane ecclesie.

The Carmelite convent in Prague was founded from Germany in 1347, and then the Kraków convent was founded from Prague. The manuscript contents follow the Carmelite usage as defined by the Ordinal of Sibert de Beka of 1312 with some additional feasts such as St. Wenceslaus and St. Ludmila, of particular significance to the tradition of Prague.
Kraków mss. 1-4 and the Wrocław manuscript were revised in the middle of the eighteenth century for continuing use in the convent; one would suppose, therefore, that the medieval version of the chant was still in use up to that time. In the course of the revision several offices had palimpsest chants for newer feasts written over them, so that much of the original chant has been lost.
This manuscript contains two misbound pages. These leaves have been switched: the leaf with page-numbering “101/102” should follow the page numbered as “118,” and the leaf numbered as “119/120” should follow page 100.

The Carmelite convent in Prague was founded from Germany in 1347, and then the Kraków convent was founded from Prague. The manuscript contents follow the Carmelite usage as defined by the Ordinal of Sibert de Beka of 1312 with some additional feasts such as St. Wenceslaus and St. Ludmila, of particular significance to the tradition of Prague.
Kraków mss. 1-4 and the Wrocław manuscript were revised in the middle of the eighteenth century for continuing use in the convent; one would suppose, therefore, that the medieval version of the chant was still in use up to that time. In the course of the revision several offices had palimpsest chants for newer feasts written over them, so that much of the original chant has been lost.
This manuscript contains two misbound pages. These leaves have been switched: the leaf with page-numbering “101/102” should follow the page numbered as “118,” and the leaf numbered as “119/120” should follow page 100.

    ns6:description "<p>This choir book has been in the possession of the Music Library at The University of Western Ontario since the late 1960s, when it was purchased from a book-dealer in Paris. Apparently, this manuscript had been part of the collection at the Burgos monastery. Its prior whereabouts are unknown. There are no names, bookplates, stamps or other marks on the inside covers or elsewhere which might reveal any information about the provenance or the travels of this book prior to its present home. The only library identification marks are those of the University of Western Ontario; these are found on the inside front cover, as well as on the recto side of the first extant folio (fol. 27). The contents offer little insight as to where this volume was produced, used, or housed during the last few centuries.<br /><br />Of the original folios which may have numbered near 200, approximately half are extant. Many have been cut away at the spine and removed from the manuscript. The size of the principal writing-space is 43.8 x 27 cm; this is the interior dimension of the frame-ruling and does not include the liturgical-occasion headings which are written across the top of facing sides in red ink. The binding is original.<br /><br />This antiphoner contains the chants sung by the choir in the Offices of the Temporale surrounding Easter. The first extant folio gives a portion of the Offices for Maundy Thursday. It is reasonable to assume that the missing twenty-six folios at the beginning of the manuscript contained the chants for the six Sundays in Lent and the remainder of Holy Week. Chants for Good Friday (including the Lamentations of Jeremiah), Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday are followed by those for the weekdays after Easter and the ensuing Sundays in the paschal season. Offices for Ascension and Pentecost are followed by chants for Corpus Christi. A lacuna of ten folios before Corpus Christi most likely accounts for the absence of an Office for Trinity Sunday. Magnificat antiphons for the Sundays after Pentecost up to the month of August fill the last extant folios of this manuscript.<br /></p>" ;

    ns6:description """It is quite clear that the monastery was under the influence of the Hirsau reform.  See article by Janka Szendrei in bibliography; the comparison with south German sources, such as the Zwiefalten antiphoner (Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek - Musikabteilung, Aug. LX), seems to confirm it.
*It is problematic that this antiphoner contains almost no rubrics.*  For example, the distribution of antiphons for the weekdays is not clear.  It is evident, however, from the size of the initials that the chants are organized, and are not merely unstructured lists of items.

    ns6:description """The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179): Scivias (1v–135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r–201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r–308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v–317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r–327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r–434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r–461v); Lingua ignotae (461v–464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v–465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r–478v); Ordo virtutum (478v–481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141–1158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. 

The Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex ("giant codex") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).

As the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard’s death, it was likely copied c. 1180–1190, following Hildegard’s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard’s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466–481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.

The chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466–472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473–481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.

The manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.

The differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.""" ;

    ns6:description """The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179): Scivias (1v–135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r–201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r–308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v–317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r–327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r–434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r–461v); Lingua ignotae (461v–464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v–465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r–478v); Ordo virtutum (478v–481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141–1158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. 

The Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex ("giant codex") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).

As the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard’s death, it was likely copied c. 1180–1190, following Hildegard’s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard’s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466–481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.

The chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466–472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473–481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.

The manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII.

There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.

The manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.

The differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.""" ;

The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141–1158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. 

The Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex ("giant codex") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).

As the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard’s death, it was likely copied c. 1180–1190, following Hildegard’s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard’s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466–481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.

The Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex ("giant codex") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).

As the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard’s death, it was likely copied c. 1180–1190, following Hildegard’s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard’s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466–481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.

The chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466–472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473–481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.

The manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.

The differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.""" ;

As the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard’s death, it was likely copied c. 1180–1190, following Hildegard’s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard’s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466–481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.

The chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466–472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473–481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.

The manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.

The differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.""" ;

Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.

Hildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141–1158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.

The Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner’s mark on f. 173v, “Liber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari” (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point “Monasterii Haffligemensis” was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and “M.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS” was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.

In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and “M.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS” was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.

The differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8).

    ns6:description """NZ-Wt MSR-03 is likely the second of a pair of antiphonals as it contains the <i>pars aestiva,</i> that is, the liturgical material from Easter Day forward, both Temporale and Sanctorale. The volume containing the <i>pars hiemalis</i> is yet to be found. <br/>
Inside the front cover of the binding on the front pastedown is the 15th-century ownership inscription, “Liber co[n]vent[us] s[anc]ti monaliu[m] s[anc]te Agathe v[ir]gi[ni]s Am[er]sfor.e.” Thus, the provenance of this book has been ascribed to the Augustinian abbey of the Sisters of the Common Life at Amersfoort. The association of NZ-Wt MSR-03 with a women’s house is further supported by the inclusion near the end of the manuscript of additional Marian chants and some less-common Offices for female saints. In more recent years, this manuscript was acquired by Albert Clemas (1880?-1956) and later sold by him in 1933 to the British and Foreign Bible Society of New Zealand. In 1978, it was deposited into the Alexander Turnbull Library, now a division of the National Library of New Zealand, on permanent loan from the Bible Society.<br/>
Just beneath the 15th-century inscription on the front pastedown appears “Hymns Versicles and antiphons” in pencil in a modern cursive hand. The first flyleaf contains more of the same hand in pencil and a cutting from an English bookseller’s catalogue that provides a different interpretation of the ownership inscription on the pastedown. The second front flyleaf is blank (recto and verso), and there is a single chant on the recto side of the third front flyleaf (indexed as f. 000r). There are no apparent folio numbers, so the inventory follows the numbering of the digital images posted online by the library. The main body of the manuscript contains 190 paper leaves (ff. 001r-190r). The following are blank: ff. 162v, 169v, 170r, 170v, and 190v.<br/>
The binding consists of plain, brown, limp vellum with a fold-over flap and repaired/renewed ties that extend around the entire book. The paper in this manuscript contain numerous watermarks: at least 11 different watermarks and variants are indicated in the library catalogue description, including versions of Briquet 3625 (1480), 6112-6113 (similar types all later 15th century), 8623 (1484), 8655-8682 (all later 15th century), 9182 (1467), 12478 (1481), and 14187-14213 (all later 15th century). The collation of leaves has the following organization: i-vi¹⁰, vii-xviii⁸, xix⁶, xx⁸, xxi⁸+², xxii¹⁰, with three different series of faint contemporary leaf signatures from “A” to “[m]” on gatherings 1-13 (ff. 000r-116v), “[a]” to “F” on gathering 14-19 (ff. 117r-162v), and from “a” to “[c]” on gatherings 20-22 (ff. 163r-190v). The gatherings are numbered in pencil in the upper-right-hand corners of the recto sides (“1” on f. 000r, “2” on 011r, “3” on f. 021r, “4” on f. 031r, “5” on f. 041r, “6” on f. 051r, “7” on f. 061r, “8” on f. 069r, “9” on f. 077r, “10” on f. 085r, “11” on f. 093r, “12” on f. 101r, “13” on f. 109r, “14” on f. 117r, “15” on f. 125r, “16” on f. 133r, “17” on f. 141r, “18” on f. 149r, “19” on f. 157r, “20” on f. 163r, “21” on f. 171r, “22” on f. 181r).<br/>
The leaves are ruled in faint plummet, with six systems per folio side of 4-line inked staves with F- and C-clefs. The notation is Hufnagelschrift. The black/brown text script is in a Gothic liturgical hand, and the library catalogue identifies three main scribes (changing after ff. 116 and 162, corresponding with changes of runs of signatures). Ff. 091v-092r appear to be in a slightly later hand with a different ink (now flaking off). Throughout the manuscript, rubrics are in red, and some liturgical directions are underlined in red. There are approximately 290 calligraphic initials in black, touched in red, infilled with black penwork (to f. 116 only) of which nearly fifty include human faces or profiles, mostly of monks or of grotesque unshaven figures spitting. Approximately 316 large initials are painted in red or occasionally in blue. Three large initials (c. 50 x 60 mm) are elaborately drawn in blue with penwork infilling and full-length marginal flourishing in red partly infilled with a green wash; these mark the beginning of the Sanctorale (f. 001r), Common of the Saints (f. 092v) and Temporale f. 117r). On f. 001r and 092v the border terminates in a bushy-tailed dragon. Space for a fourth large initial for Pentecost (f. 136r) was left blank.""" ;

    ns6:description """NZ-Wt MSR-03 is likely the second of a pair of antiphonals as it contains the <i>pars aestiva,</i> that is, the liturgical material from Easter Day forward, both Temporale and Sanctorale. The volume containing the <i>pars hiemalis</i> is yet to be found. <br/>
Inside the front cover of the binding on the front pastedown is the 15th-century ownership inscription, “Liber co[n]vent[us] s[anc]ti monaliu[m] s[anc]te Agathe v[ir]gi[ni]s Am[er]sfor.e.” Thus, the provenance of this book has been ascribed to the Augustinian abbey of the Sisters of the Common Life at Amersfoort. The association of NZ-Wt MSR-03 with a women’s house is further supported by the inclusion near the end of the manuscript of additional Marian chants and some less-common Offices for female saints. In more recent years, this manuscript was acquired by Albert Clemas (1880?-1956) and later sold by him in 1933 to the British and Foreign Bible Society of New Zealand. In 1978, it was deposited into the Alexander Turnbull Library, now a division of the National Library of New Zealand, on permanent loan from the Bible Society.<br/>
Just beneath the 15th-century inscription on the front pastedown appears “Hymns Versicles and antiphons” in pencil in a modern cursive hand. The first flyleaf contains more of the same hand in pencil and a cutting from an English bookseller’s catalogue that provides a different interpretation of the ownership inscription on the pastedown. The second front flyleaf is blank (recto and verso), and there is a single chant on the recto side of the third front flyleaf (indexed as f. 000r). There are no apparent folio numbers, so the inventory follows the numbering of the digital images posted online by the library. The main body of the manuscript contains 190 paper leaves (ff. 001r-190r). The following are blank: ff. 162v, 169v, 170r, 170v, and 190v.<br/>
The binding consists of plain, brown, limp vellum with a fold-over flap and repaired/renewed ties that extend around the entire book. The paper in this manuscript contain numerous watermarks: at least 11 different watermarks and variants are indicated in the library catalogue description, including versions of Briquet 3625 (1480), 6112-6113 (similar types all later 15th century), 8623 (1484), 8655-8682 (all later 15th century), 9182 (1467), 12478 (1481), and 14187-14213 (all later 15th century). The collation of leaves has the following organization: i-vi¹⁰, vii-xviii⁸, xix⁶, xx⁸, xxi⁸+², xxii¹⁰, with three different series of faint contemporary leaf signatures from “A” to “[m]” on gatherings 1-13 (ff. 000r-116v), “[a]” to “F” on gathering 14-19 (ff. 117r-162v), and from “a” to “[c]” on gatherings 20-22 (ff. 163r-190v). The gatherings are numbered in pencil in the upper-right-hand corners of the recto sides (“1” on f. 000r, “2” on 011r, “3” on f. 021r, “4” on f. 031r, “5” on f. 041r, “6” on f. 051r, “7” on f. 061r, “8” on f. 069r, “9” on f. 077r, “10” on f. 085r, “11” on f. 093r, “12” on f. 101r, “13” on f. 109r, “14” on f. 117r, “15” on f. 125r, “16” on f. 133r, “17” on f. 141r, “18” on f. 149r, “19” on f. 157r, “20” on f. 163r, “21” on f. 171r, “22” on f. 181r).<br/>
The leaves are ruled in faint plummet, with six systems per folio side of 4-line inked staves with F- and C-clefs. The notation is Hufnagelschrift. The black/brown text script is in a Gothic liturgical hand, and the library catalogue identifies three main scribes (changing after ff. 116 and 162, corresponding with changes of runs of signatures). Ff. 091v-092r appear to be in a slightly later hand with a different ink (now flaking off). Throughout the manuscript, rubrics are in red, and some liturgical directions are underlined in red. There are approximately 290 calligraphic initials in black, touched in red, infilled with black penwork (to f. 116 only) of which nearly fifty include human faces or profiles, mostly of monks or of grotesque unshaven figures spitting. Approximately 316 large initials are painted in red or occasionally in blue. Three large initials (c. 50 x 60 mm) are elaborately drawn in blue with penwork infilling and full-length marginal flourishing in red partly infilled with a green wash; these mark the beginning of the Sanctorale (f. 001r), Common of the Saints (f. 092v) and Temporale f. 117r). On f. 001r and 092v the border terminates in a bushy-tailed dragon. Space for a fourth large initial for Pentecost (f. 136r) was left blank.""" ;

    ns6:description """The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179): Scivias (1v–135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r–201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r–308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v–317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r–327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r–434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r–461v); Lingua ignotae (461v–464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v–465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r–478v); Ordo virtutum (478v–481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141–1158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. 

The Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex ("giant codex") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).

As the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard’s death, it was likely copied c. 1180–1190, following Hildegard’s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard’s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466–481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.

The chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466–472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473–481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.

The manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.

The differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.""" ;

    ns6:description """The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179): Scivias (1v–135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r–201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r–308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v–317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r–327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r–434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r–461v); Lingua ignotae (461v–464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v–465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r–478v); Ordo virtutum (478v–481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141–1158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. 

The Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex ("giant codex") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).

As the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard’s death, it was likely copied c. 1180–1190, following Hildegard’s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard’s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466–481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.

The chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466–472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473–481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.

The manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.

The differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.""" ;

    ns6:description """The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179): Scivias (1v–135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r–201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r–308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v–317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r–327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r–434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r–461v); Lingua ignotae (461v–464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v–465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r–478v); Ordo virtutum (478v–481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141–1158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. 

The Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex ("giant codex") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).

As the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard’s death, it was likely copied c. 1180–1190, following Hildegard’s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard’s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466–481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.

The chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466–472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473–481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.

The manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.

The differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.""" ;

    ns6:description """The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179): Scivias (1v–135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r–201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r–308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v–317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r–327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r–434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r–461v); Lingua ignotae (461v–464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v–465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r–478v); Ordo virtutum (478v–481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141–1158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. 

The Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex ("giant codex") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).

As the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard’s death, it was likely copied c. 1180–1190, following Hildegard’s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard’s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466–481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.

The chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466–472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473–481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.

The manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.

The differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.""" ;

    ns6:description """The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179): Scivias (1v–135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r–201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r–308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v–317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r–327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r–434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r–461v); Lingua ignotae (461v–464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v–465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r–478v); Ordo virtutum (478v–481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141–1158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. 

The Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex ("giant codex") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).

As the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard’s death, it was likely copied c. 1180–1190, following Hildegard’s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard’s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466–481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.

The chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466–472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473–481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.

The manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.

The differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.""" ;

    ns6:description """NZ-Wt MSR-03 is likely the second of a pair of antiphonals as it contains the <i>pars aestiva,</i> that is, the liturgical material from Easter Day forward, both Temporale and Sanctorale. The volume containing the <i>pars hiemalis</i> is yet to be found. <br/>
Inside the front cover of the binding on the front pastedown is the 15th-century ownership inscription, “Liber co[n]vent[us] s[anc]ti monaliu[m] s[anc]te Agathe v[ir]gi[ni]s Am[er]sfor.e.” Thus, the provenance of this book has been ascribed to the Augustinian abbey of the Sisters of the Common Life at Amersfoort. The association of NZ-Wt MSR-03 with a women’s house is further supported by the inclusion near the end of the manuscript of additional Marian chants and some less-common Offices for female saints. In more recent years, this manuscript was acquired by Albert Clemas (1880?-1956) and later sold by him in 1933 to the British and Foreign Bible Society of New Zealand. In 1978, it was deposited into the Alexander Turnbull Library, now a division of the National Library of New Zealand, on permanent loan from the Bible Society.<br/>
Just beneath the 15th-century inscription on the front pastedown appears “Hymns Versicles and antiphons” in pencil in a modern cursive hand. The first flyleaf contains more of the same hand in pencil and a cutting from an English bookseller’s catalogue that provides a different interpretation of the ownership inscription on the pastedown. The second front flyleaf is blank (recto and verso), and there is a single chant on the recto side of the third front flyleaf (indexed as f. 000r). There are no apparent folio numbers, so the inventory follows the numbering of the digital images posted online by the library. The main body of the manuscript contains 190 paper leaves (ff. 001r-190r). The following are blank: ff. 162v, 169v, 170r, 170v, and 190v.<br/>
The binding consists of plain, brown, limp vellum with a fold-over flap and repaired/renewed ties that extend around the entire book. The paper in this manuscript contain numerous watermarks: at least 11 different watermarks and variants are indicated in the library catalogue description, including versions of Briquet 3625 (1480), 6112-6113 (similar types all later 15th century), 8623 (1484), 8655-8682 (all later 15th century), 9182 (1467), 12478 (1481), and 14187-14213 (all later 15th century). The collation of leaves has the following organization: i-vi¹⁰, vii-xviii⁸, xix⁶, xx⁸, xxi⁸+², xxii¹⁰, with three different series of faint contemporary leaf signatures from “A” to “[m]” on gatherings 1-13 (ff. 000r-116v), “[a]” to “F” on gathering 14-19 (ff. 117r-162v), and from “a” to “[c]” on gatherings 20-22 (ff. 163r-190v). The gatherings are numbered in pencil in the upper-right-hand corners of the recto sides (“1” on f. 000r, “2” on 011r, “3” on f. 021r, “4” on f. 031r, “5” on f. 041r, “6” on f. 051r, “7” on f. 061r, “8” on f. 069r, “9” on f. 077r, “10” on f. 085r, “11” on f. 093r, “12” on f. 101r, “13” on f. 109r, “14” on f. 117r, “15” on f. 125r, “16” on f. 133r, “17” on f. 141r, “18” on f. 149r, “19” on f. 157r, “20” on f. 163r, “21” on f. 171r, “22” on f. 181r).<br/>
The leaves are ruled in faint plummet, with six systems per folio side of 4-line inked staves with F- and C-clefs. The notation is Hufnagelschrift. The black/brown text script is in a Gothic liturgical hand, and the library catalogue identifies three main scribes (changing after ff. 116 and 162, corresponding with changes of runs of signatures). Ff. 091v-092r appear to be in a slightly later hand with a different ink (now flaking off). Throughout the manuscript, rubrics are in red, and some liturgical directions are underlined in red. There are approximately 290 calligraphic initials in black, touched in red, infilled with black penwork (to f. 116 only) of which nearly fifty include human faces or profiles, mostly of monks or of grotesque unshaven figures spitting. Approximately 316 large initials are painted in red or occasionally in blue. Three large initials (c. 50 x 60 mm) are elaborately drawn in blue with penwork infilling and full-length marginal flourishing in red partly infilled with a green wash; these mark the beginning of the Sanctorale (f. 001r), Common of the Saints (f. 092v) and Temporale f. 117r). On f. 001r and 092v the border terminates in a bushy-tailed dragon. Space for a fourth large initial for Pentecost (f. 136r) was left blank.""" ;

Besides the Mass chants, in order throughout the liturgical year, there are appendices of <i>Alleluia</i> verses, hymns, antiphons for several occasions, and a neumed <i>versicularium</i> (<i>Psalmi ad Communionem</i>). The first page(s) are missing; the Gradual starts with the Alleluia <i>Ostende nobis Domine</i> of the 1st Sunday in Advent. In the Gradual, the Temporale and Sanctorale are not separated.

The codex was written in Einsiedeln, likely for the third abbot of the cloister, Gregor the Englishman. Some chants are neumed by later hands. The pages of Einsiedeln 121 are numbered with a modern hand in black ink in the upper outside corners of the leaves (pp. 1-600); there is no original numbering. The manuscript includes various illuminated letters, mostly in the Gradual, and three large illustrations that cover the entire page: an ornamented monogram (p. 204: <i>In die sancto Resurrectionis Domini ad Missam</i>), the ornamented “Resurrexi” of Easter Sunday’s Introit (p. 205), and another ornamented monogram (p. 436: <i>In nomine Domini incipit Lyber Ymnorum Notkeri</i>).""" ;

    ns6:description """NZ-Wt MSR-03 is likely the second of a pair of antiphonals as it contains the <i>pars aestiva,</i> that is, the liturgical material from Easter Day forward, both Temporale and Sanctorale. The volume containing the <i>pars hiemalis</i> is yet to be found. <br/>
Inside the front cover of the binding on the front pastedown is the 15th-century ownership inscription, “Liber co[n]vent[us] s[anc]ti monaliu[m] s[anc]te Agathe v[ir]gi[ni]s Am[er]sfor.e.” Thus, the provenance of this book has been ascribed to the Augustinian abbey of the Sisters of the Common Life at Amersfoort. The association of NZ-Wt MSR-03 with a women’s house is further supported by the inclusion near the end of the manuscript of additional Marian chants and some less-common Offices for female saints. In more recent years, this manuscript was acquired by Albert Clemas (1880?-1956) and later sold by him in 1933 to the British and Foreign Bible Society of New Zealand. In 1978, it was deposited into the Alexander Turnbull Library, now a division of the National Library of New Zealand, on permanent loan from the Bible Society.<br/>
Just beneath the 15th-century inscription on the front pastedown appears “Hymns Versicles and antiphons” in pencil in a modern cursive hand. The first flyleaf contains more of the same hand in pencil and a cutting from an English bookseller’s catalogue that provides a different interpretation of the ownership inscription on the pastedown. The second front flyleaf is blank (recto and verso), and there is a single chant on the recto side of the third front flyleaf (indexed as f. 000r). There are no apparent folio numbers, so the inventory follows the numbering of the digital images posted online by the library. The main body of the manuscript contains 190 paper leaves (ff. 001r-190r). The following are blank: ff. 162v, 169v, 170r, 170v, and 190v.<br/>
The binding consists of plain, brown, limp vellum with a fold-over flap and repaired/renewed ties that extend around the entire book. The paper in this manuscript contain numerous watermarks: at least 11 different watermarks and variants are indicated in the library catalogue description, including versions of Briquet 3625 (1480), 6112-6113 (similar types all later 15th century), 8623 (1484), 8655-8682 (all later 15th century), 9182 (1467), 12478 (1481), and 14187-14213 (all later 15th century). The collation of leaves has the following organization: i-vi¹⁰, vii-xviii⁸, xix⁶, xx⁸, xxi⁸+², xxii¹⁰, with three different series of faint contemporary leaf signatures from “A” to “[m]” on gatherings 1-13 (ff. 000r-116v), “[a]” to “F” on gathering 14-19 (ff. 117r-162v), and from “a” to “[c]” on gatherings 20-22 (ff. 163r-190v). The gatherings are numbered in pencil in the upper-right-hand corners of the recto sides (“1” on f. 000r, “2” on 011r, “3” on f. 021r, “4” on f. 031r, “5” on f. 041r, “6” on f. 051r, “7” on f. 061r, “8” on f. 069r, “9” on f. 077r, “10” on f. 085r, “11” on f. 093r, “12” on f. 101r, “13” on f. 109r, “14” on f. 117r, “15” on f. 125r, “16” on f. 133r, “17” on f. 141r, “18” on f. 149r, “19” on f. 157r, “20” on f. 163r, “21” on f. 171r, “22” on f. 181r).<br/>
The leaves are ruled in faint plummet, with six systems per folio side of 4-line inked staves with F- and C-clefs. The notation is Hufnagelschrift. The black/brown text script is in a Gothic liturgical hand, and the library catalogue identifies three main scribes (changing after ff. 116 and 162, corresponding with changes of runs of signatures). Ff. 091v-092r appear to be in a slightly later hand with a different ink (now flaking off). Throughout the manuscript, rubrics are in red, and some liturgical directions are underlined in red. There are approximately 290 calligraphic initials in black, touched in red, infilled with black penwork (to f. 116 only) of which nearly fifty include human faces or profiles, mostly of monks or of grotesque unshaven figures spitting. Approximately 316 large initials are painted in red or occasionally in blue. Three large initials (c. 50 x 60 mm) are elaborately drawn in blue with penwork infilling and full-length marginal flourishing in red partly infilled with a green wash; these mark the beginning of the Sanctorale (f. 001r), Common of the Saints (f. 092v) and Temporale f. 117r). On f. 001r and 092v the border terminates in a bushy-tailed dragon. Space for a fourth large initial for Pentecost (f. 136r) was left blank.""" ;

The volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: “Tiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas” (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book’s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. 

The binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).
 
On the middle of the verso side of the book’s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book’s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.

The volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: “Tiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas” (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book’s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. 

The binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).
 
On the middle of the verso side of the book’s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book’s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.

The volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: “Tiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3.

The binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).
 
On the middle of the verso side of the book’s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book’s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.

    ns6:description """Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner’s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. 
 
The volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: “Tiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas” (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book’s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. 

The binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).
 
On the middle of the verso side of the book’s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book’s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.

    ns6:description """Since Didacus of Alcalá was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.

The manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r–115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir–XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r–148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist’s hand on ff. 146v–148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: ê). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).

This fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Massó), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.""" ;

The manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r–115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir–XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r–148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist’s hand on ff. 146v–148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: ê). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).

This fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Massó), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.""" ;

The volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: “Tiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas” (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book’s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. 

The binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).
 
On the middle of the verso side of the book’s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book’s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.

    ns6:description """Since Didacus of Alcalá was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.

The manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r–115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir–XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r–148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist’s hand on ff. 146v–148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: ê). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).

This fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019).

    ns6:description """Since Didacus of Alcalá was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.

The manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r–115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir–XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r–148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist’s hand on ff. 146v–148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: ê). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).

This fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Massó), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.""" ;

The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r–148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist’s hand on ff. 146v–148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: ê). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).

This fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019).

    ns6:description """Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner’s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. 
 
The volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: “Tiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas” (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book’s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. 

The binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).
 
On the middle of the verso side of the book’s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book’s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.

    ns6:description """Since Didacus of Alcalá was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.

The manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r–115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir–XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r–148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist’s hand on ff. 146v–148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: ê). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).

This fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Massó), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.""" ;

The volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: “Tiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3.

The binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).

    ns6:description """Since Didacus of Alcalá was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.

The manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r–115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir–XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r–148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist’s hand on ff. 146v–148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: ê). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).

This fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Massó), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.""" ;

The volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: “Tiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas” (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book’s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. 

The binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).
 
On the middle of the verso side of the book’s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book’s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.

    ns6:description """Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner’s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. 
 
The volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: “Tiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas” (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book’s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. 

The binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).
 
On the middle of the verso side of the book’s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book’s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.

    ns6:description """Since Didacus of Alcalá was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.

The manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r–115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir–XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r–148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist’s hand on ff. 146v–148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: ê). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).

This fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Massó), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.""" ;

This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).
 
On the middle of the verso side of the book’s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book.

The volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: “Tiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas” (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book’s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. 

The binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).
 
On the middle of the verso side of the book’s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book’s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.

    ns6:description """Since Didacus of Alcalá was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.

The manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r–115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir–XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r–148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist’s hand on ff. 146v–148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: ê). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).

This fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Massó), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.""" ;

The volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: “Tiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3.

The binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).
 
On the middle of the verso side of the book’s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book’s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.

    ns6:description """Since Didacus of Alcalá was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.

The manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r–115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir–XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r–148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist’s hand on ff. 146v–148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: ê). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).

This fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Massó), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.""" ;

    ns6:description """Since Didacus of Alcalá was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.

The manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r–115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir–XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r–148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist’s hand on ff. 146v–148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: ê). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).

This fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Massó), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.""" ;

    ns6:description """Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner’s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. 
 
The volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: “Tiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas” (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book’s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. 

The binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).
 
On the middle of the verso side of the book’s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book’s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.

    ns6:description """Single leaf from a gradual. Square notation in black ink on red five-line staves with F- and C-clefs; 7 lines per folio side. The textual script appears to be in late Gothic minim style with suggestions of rounded, humanistic pen-strokes. This leaf dates, perhaps, from the late-fifteenth or early-sixteenth century (?). 48.7 x 33.3 cm, with a principal writing space of 37.2 x 23.4 cm. Acquired at an estate sale in California, USA. Currently in the private collection of S. Helak (2018).

The contents do not indicate the feast, but give an introit followed by several gradual verses and rubrics for readings corresponding to the extended reading/responsory material for Ember Saturday in Lent. 
The marginal VACAT is probably calling the user's attention to the fact that the responsory "Protector noster" is not given in full on this leaf.

    ns6:description """Since Didacus of Alcalá was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.

The manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r–115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir–XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r–148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist’s hand on ff. 146v–148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: ê). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).

This fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Massó), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.""" ;

BKT.006 (the ‘Tsgrooten Antiphoner’) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume—with chants from Advent to Holy Week—is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. 

All three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. 

B-Gu, Hs. BKT.006—along with its companion volumes—was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.

Prior to the abbey’s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.""" ;

BKT.006 (the ‘Tsgrooten Antiphoner’) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume—with chants from Advent to Holy Week—is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. 

All three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. 

B-Gu, Hs. BKT.006—along with its companion volumes—was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.

Prior to the abbey’s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.""" ;

B-Gu, Hs. BKT.006—along with its companion volumes—was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.

Prior to the abbey’s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.""" ;

BKT.006 (the ‘Tsgrooten Antiphoner’) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume—with chants from Advent to Holy Week—is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426).
