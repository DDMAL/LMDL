Using the steps described in simssadb_pipeline.md, we get the final_flattened CSV. This CSV merges all tables in the SQL file into one single CSV. For this single CSV to be better converted into RDF using the csv2rdf script, different entities should be moved to other CSV file. For example, in the final_flattened CSV, after line 496, the musical_work_id is no longer the primary key of the records. 
Cut & Paste all texts after line 496 into another CSV file, import it into OpenRefine, and delete the previous two empty columns.
In the new CSV, the source_id is chosen to be the new primary key. In this case, for the csv2rdf script to process the data correctly, the records with musical_work_id as the primary key and the records with source_id as the primary key should exist in two different CSV files.
