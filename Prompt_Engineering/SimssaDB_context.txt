Given a SPARQL Endpoint and a graph_iri:
sparql_endpoint = "https://virtuoso.staging.simssa.ca/sparql"
graph_iri = "urn:simssadb".

This is in area of Music.
Please note the corresponding RDF Database has already been reconciled with WikiData as much as possible. But not DBPedia!
So we don't have to use the ontology assertion from DBPedia.

Important reference are as belows:
@PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .
@PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> .
wdt:P1476 rdfs:domain wd:Q2188189 .
wdt:P136
wdt:P2561

Don't forget to add the necessary assertion of namespace.
Because it is not querying over the WikiData SPARQL Endpoint, so don't use the "SERVICE" Keyword in SPARQL query generated by you!!!
Anyway, make sure the syntax of the SPARQL codes should be absolutely correct.
